# GAN-Project
Creating Anime Faces using Gan

# Little bit about Gan
Gan is highly used in the field of image creation. It consist of a generator and a discriminator. They both use the convolution layer perform there individual work. The two, generator and discriminator can be define as the rivals where improvement of will also help to improve the other. The work generator to upsample the input provided. The input in the generator is the random noise. The discriminator work in normal fashion and help to classify the input image as real and fake. The discriminator trained with both real image from data set and fake images created by the genrator hence the generator and disciminator grow together.

# Dataset
The dataset I use is consist of less image therefore I am providing a better data set from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/splcher/animefacedataset. The data set consist of images only. Some samples are here.


# Step to follow:
1. Download the datset. The data set provided at kaggle have high quality so better result are expected than shown here.
2. Try to understand the code the code is quite self-explainatory.
3. It take lot of iteration to get the good results about 80000 to 130000 iteration.

# Result
